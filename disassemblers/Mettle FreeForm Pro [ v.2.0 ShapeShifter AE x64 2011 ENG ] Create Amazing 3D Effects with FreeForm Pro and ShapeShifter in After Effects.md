But that's not all. Mettle FreeForm Pro also has a generator feature that lets you replicate your 3D object multiple times on a single layer and control and animate the replications with one set of controls. You can also transform your layer into an array of primitives such as cubes, tetrahedrons, octahedrons, icosahedrons, rods, and planes. You can assign Ae layers (including animated pre-comps) as a texture and use time sampling controls (random still frame and random loop) to create dynamic effects.
 
Moreover, Mettle FreeForm Pro has advanced rendering options such as normals, UV, shadows, x-ray, and points. You can also add the fresnel lens phenomenon to your work and create additional 3D materials such as water and glass. You can use different channels to isolate different regions on your 3D model and give them different reflections and finishes. You can also use displacement map noise to create natural-looking organic surfaces and animations using mathematical algorithms instead of additional geometry.
 
Finally, Mettle FreeForm Pro is compatible with GEOLayers2 plugin and can render your animations in 360Â° with the built-in immersive tools in CC 2018 and higher. You can also use a separate environment map or use your reflection map as the background for your scene. You can also add mist and fog effects to your skydome background.
