## Radimpex Tower 7: Examples of Projects and Applications
 
Radimpex Tower 7 is not only a powerful software for structural analysis and design, but also a versatile and flexible tool that can be applied to various types of projects and applications. In this article, we will showcase some examples of how Tower 7 can be used to model, analyze and design different structures, such as frames, trusses, slabs, beams, bridges, halls and more.
 
### Frame in Plane - Data Input and Results Processing
 
This example shows the model of a simple steel frame with tie downs (members with non-linear behavior) in a vertical plane. It demonstrates the procedure of defining the geometry and cross sections, placing and defining supports and applying loads. It also shows the results processing, including the design of steel members[^2^].

### Truss in Plane - Data Input and Results Processing
 
This example shows the model of a simple timber truss in a vertical plane. It demonstrates the procedure of defining the geometry and cross sections, placing and defining supports and applying loads. It also shows the results processing, including the design of timber members[^2^].
 
### Floor Structure - Data Input and Results Processing
 
This example shows the model of a simple concrete floor structure consisting of a slab and beams. It demonstrates the procedure of defining the geometry and characteristics of the slab and beams, defining supports, applying loads, generating finite element mesh and performing analysis. It also shows the procedure of designing and adopting reinforcement in slabs and beams, as well as exporting the adopted reinforcement to ArmCAD[^2^].
 
### Continuous Beam - Data Input and Results Processing
 
This example shows the analysis of the influence of moving load on a simple structure - a continuous beam. The analysis is performed in two ways - using moving load and using influence line. It demonstrates the procedure of defining the geometry and cross sections of the beam, defining and applying moving load and defining influence lines. It also shows the obtained results, the procedure of defining load schemes and determining the critical position of moving load[^2^].
 
### Steel Hall - Data Input and Results Processing
 
This example shows the model of a steel hall with a gable roof. It demonstrates the procedure of defining the geometry and cross sections of the hall elements, placing supports, applying loads (including wind load), generating finite element mesh and performing analysis. It also shows the results processing, including internal forces diagrams, displacements contours, stresses contours and design of steel members[^2^].
 
These are just some examples of how Radimpex Tower 7 can be used to model, analyze and design different structures. You can find more examples on the official website of Radimpex Software[^1^], where you can also download tutorials, user manuals, galleries and showcases for Tower 7.
