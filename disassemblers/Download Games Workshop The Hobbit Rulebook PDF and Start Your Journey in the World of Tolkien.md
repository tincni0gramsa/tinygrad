However, to play the game, you need to have the rulebook that explains how to set up and play the game, as well as the profiles and special rules for the different characters and factions. The rulebook is called The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journeyâ¢ rules manual, and it was released in 2012 along with the first movie of The Hobbit trilogy.
 
The rulebook is a hardcover book with 288 pages, full of beautiful illustrations, photos, and diagrams. It covers everything you need to know to play the game, from the basic rules of movement, shooting, combat, and morale, to the advanced rules of heroes, monsters, magic, and scenarios. It also includes a comprehensive hobby section that shows you how to assemble, paint, and base your miniatures, as well as how to create terrain and scenery for your games.
 
The rulebook is not cheap, though. It costs $85 USD on the Games Workshop website[^1^], and it might be hard to find in some local stores or online retailers. If you want to save some money or just have a digital copy of the rulebook for convenience, you might be wondering if there is a way to download The Hobbit rulebook PDF for free.
 
The answer is yes, but it is not legal or ethical. The rulebook is a copyrighted product of Games Workshop, and downloading it without paying for it is a violation of their intellectual property rights. You might be able to find some websites or torrents that offer The Hobbit rulebook PDF for free download[^2^] [^3^], but they are likely to be unsafe, unreliable, or incomplete. You might end up with a corrupted file, a virus, or a lawsuit.
