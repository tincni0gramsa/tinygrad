- **Quality:** The 1080p version has a higher resolution and more details than the 720p version. It also has better sound quality, as it uses PCM audio instead of AAC. The 1080p version was restored from the original negative by Criterion Collection in 2015, while the 720p version was ripped from a Blu-ray disc by YTS in 2020[^2^]. If you want to enjoy the movie in its full glory, the 1080p version is the way to go.
- **Size:** The 1080p version has a larger file size than the 720p version. It is about 1.13 GB, while the 720p version is only 988 MB[^2^]. If you have limited storage space or bandwidth, you might prefer the 720p version.
- **Availability:** The 1080p version is not widely available online. You can find it on Internet Archive[^1^], but you might have to wait for a long time to download it. The 720p version is more accessible, as you can find it on YTS[^2^], OpenSea[^3^], and SoundCloud[^4^]. However, you should be careful of the legal and ethical issues of downloading or streaming pirated content.

- **Artistry:** The Apu Trilogy is widely regarded as one of the greatest achievements of world cinema. It showcases the genius of Satyajit Ray, who wrote, directed, produced and edited the films with minimal resources and maximum creativity. Ray was influenced by both Indian and Western traditions, blending realism, lyricism, symbolism and humanism in his cinematic style. He also collaborated with talented artists such as cinematographer Subrata Mitra, editor Dulal Dutta and composer Ravi Shankar, who contributed to the aesthetic excellence of the films.
- **Emotion:** The Apu Trilogy is a powerful and poignant portrait of a life full of joys and sorrows, hopes and disappointments, dreams and realities. It captures the universal themes of childhood innocence, family bonds, love and loss, education and ambition, identity and belonging. The films evoke a range of emotions in the viewers, from laughter to tears, from wonder to awe, from empathy to admiration. The films also feature remarkable performances by mostly non-professional actors, especially the children who played Apu and his sister Durga.
- **Culture:** The Apu Trilogy is a rich and authentic representation of Indian culture, especially that of Bengal in the early 20th century. It depicts the social and historical context of the time, such as the caste system, the rural-urban divide, the colonial rule, the nationalist movement and the partition. It also showcases the beauty and diversity of the Indian landscape, from the lush countryside to the crowded city, from the sacred river to the majestic mountains. It also introduces the viewers to the artistic and spiritual heritage of India, such as its literature, music, religion and philosophy.

In short, Panther Panchali and its sequels are not just movies; they are masterpieces that will enrich your mind and soul. They are essential viewing for anyone who loves cinema and humanity.
