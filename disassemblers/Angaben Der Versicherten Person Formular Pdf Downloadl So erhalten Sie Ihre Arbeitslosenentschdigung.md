## Benefits and Pensions from the German Social Security System
 
The German social security system consists of five branches: health insurance, long-term care insurance, pension insurance, unemployment insurance, and accident insurance. Each branch provides different benefits and pensions to people who are insured and meet certain criteria. The Angaben Der Versicherten Person Formular PDF is mainly used for applying for benefits or pensions from the pension insurance branch, which covers old-age, disability, and survivors' pensions.
 
The pension insurance branch pays monthly pensions to people who have reached the statutory retirement age and have paid contributions for a minimum number of years. The retirement age varies depending on the year of birth and the type of pension. For example, the standard retirement age for people born in 1964 or later is 67 years, while the early retirement age for people with reduced earning capacity is 63 years. The amount of pension depends on the person's earnings, contribution years, and personal factors.
 
The pension insurance branch also pays monthly pensions to people who are unable to work due to a physical or mental impairment that reduces their earning capacity by at least 50%. The disability pension can be partial or full, depending on the degree of impairment. The amount of pension depends on the person's earnings, contribution years, personal factors, and disability degree.
 
The pension insurance branch also pays monthly pensions to surviving spouses or children of deceased insured persons. The survivor's pension can be widow's or widower's pension, orphan's pension, or parent's pension. The amount of pension depends on the deceased person's earnings, contribution years, personal factors, and the survivor's income and marital status.
 
In addition to monthly pensions, the pension insurance branch also provides other benefits and services to insured persons and their families. These include rehabilitation measures, integration assistance, education and training grants, death grants, and supplementary benefits. These benefits and services aim to help insured persons maintain or improve their health, work ability, and living standards.
