## Step 1: Install the software
 
First, you need to download the software from the official website[^5^] or from a trusted source. The file name is GEAR PRO Mastering Edition 8.10 Setup KeyGen.rar, which contains the setup file and the keygen file. You need to extract the files using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. Then, run the setup file and follow the instructions to install the software on your computer. You will need to enter a serial number that you can generate using the keygen file.
 
## Step 2: Create a project
 
Next, you need to create a project for your CD or DVD title. You can do this by clicking on File > New Project in the menu bar. You will see a dialog box where you can choose the type of project you want to create: CD-ROM (ISO), CD-Audio (Red Book), DVD-Video (UDF), DVD-ROM (UDF), or Mixed Mode (CD-ROM + CD-Audio). You can also specify the name of your project and the location where you want to save it.
 
After you create your project, you will see a window with two panes: the source pane on the left and the destination pane on the right. The source pane shows the files and folders that you want to include in your project, while the destination pane shows how they will be arranged on your disc. You can drag and drop files and folders from your computer or from other sources into the source pane. You can also use the toolbar buttons to add, delete, rename, or move files and folders.
 
## Step 3: Configure the settings
 
Before you burn your project to a disc or create a DDP image, you need to configure some settings for your project. You can do this by clicking on Project > Properties in the menu bar. You will see a dialog box with several tabs where you can adjust various options for your project.
 
For example, on the General tab, you can change the volume name, volume set name, publisher name, data preparer name, application name, system identifier, volume identifier, copyright file name, abstract file name, and bibliographic file name for your project. On the Format tab, you can choose the file system format for your project: ISO 9660 Level 1 or 2, Joliet, UDF 1.02 or 1.50, or UDF Bridge (ISO + UDF). On the Options tab, you can enable or disable some features such as multisession mode, disc-at-once mode, verify after write mode, finalize disc mode, etc.
