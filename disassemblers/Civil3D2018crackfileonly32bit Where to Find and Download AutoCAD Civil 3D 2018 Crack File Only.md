6. To add data to the surface, right-click on the surface name and choose Add Data.
7. In the Add Data dialog box, choose the type of data you want to add. For example, you can add point groups, contour data, breaklines, boundaries, etc.
8. Specify the options for each data type and click OK.
9. The surface is updated with the new data. You can see the changes in the drawing area and in the Toolspace.

To edit a surface in Civil 3D 2018, follow these steps:
