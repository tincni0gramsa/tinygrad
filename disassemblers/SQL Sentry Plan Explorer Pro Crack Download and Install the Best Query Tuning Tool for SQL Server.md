## How to Install SQL Sentry Plan Explorer Pro
 
You can download SQL Sentry Plan Explorer Pro for free from [here](https://www.sentryone.com/plan-explorer). The installation file contains both the application and the SSMS add-in, which allows you to jump directly to Plan Explorer from SSMS. You will need to have .NET Framework 4.7.1 or higher installed on your machine before running the installer.
 
Once you have installed the tool, you can launch it from the Start menu or from SSMS. To launch it from SSMS, right-click on a query in the query editor or on an execution plan in the plan viewer, and select "View with SQL Sentry Plan Explorer". This will open Plan Explorer with the query text and the execution plan loaded.
  
## How to Analyze Execution Plans with SQL Sentry Plan Explorer Pro
 
One of the main features of Plan Explorer is its superior plan diagram. It uses different colors, shapes, and sizes to highlight expensive operations, data flow, parallelism, warnings, and other information. You can also customize the layout and zoom level of the diagram to suit your preferences.

Besides the visual representation of the plan, Plan Explorer also provides many details about each plan operator that are either not available or hard to find in SSMS. For example, you can see runtime metrics such as actual rows, actual reads, actual CPU time, actual duration, etc. without manually setting statistics options or digging into a plan's properties. You can also see the estimated row count and size per column for each operator, which can help you identify cardinality estimation errors.
 
To view these details, you can use the Properties panel on the right side of the Plan Explorer window. You can also use the Statements Tree panel on the left side to navigate through different statements and operators in the plan. You can sort by any metric in most grids by clicking on the column header.
  
## How to Use Index Analysis with SQL Sentry Plan Explorer Pro
 
Another useful feature of Plan Explorer is its index analysis. It helps you determine the best index to support a given query by using scoring algorithms. It also allows you to create and modify indexes, and detect and update old statistics.
 
To use this feature, you need to have an actual execution plan generated by Plan Explorer. Then, you can switch to the Index Analysis tab at the bottom of the window. There you will see a list of recommended indexes for your query, along with their scores and impact on your query cost. You can also see a histogram of the data distribution for each index column.
 
You can create a new index by clicking on the "New Index" button at the top of the tab. You can also modify an existing index by double-clicking on it or right-clicking on it and selecting "Edit Index". You can change the index name, columns, included columns, partition scheme, fill factor, etc. As you make changes, you will see how they affect the index score and query cost.
 
You can also update statistics for an existing index by right-clicking on it and selecting "Update Statistics". This will refresh the
